## Overview

![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/detinsley1s/404NotFound/main/screenshot.png)

Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Where can I see your demo?

  You can see my demo at: https://detinsley1s.github.io/404NotFound/
- What was your experience?

  My experience was educational. I had to figure out how to layout the website similar to two screenshots. I had the benefit of a Figma example, where I could view the fonts and colors used, but I did the layout myself using Flexbox. It took me longer than I would have liked, but I hope to get better with more practice.
- What have you learned/improved?

  I learned better ways of making responsive images and using media queries, so that a site can be viewed both on the desktop and on a phone responsively. I'm still not perfect, but every project I make should help me improve.
- Your wisdom? :)

  Practice, practice, and more practice is what it takes to get better. Sometimes you want to quit, but keep at it. I did, and now it's on to more learning, more practicing, and, when I'm ready, the next project.
